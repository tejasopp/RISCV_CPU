# RISCV_CPU
This repository contains the Verilog code for a RISC-V CPU implementing the RV32I instruction set architecture (ISA). Designed using Intel Quartus, this CPU supports various instruction types, including R, I, S, B, U, and J, using a single-pipeline architecture. Module instantiation is used for a modular and scalable design.

This CPU can implement following instructions efficiently:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a91c704-e7a8-4b7a-bdc6-51d030ead9b7)
